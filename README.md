Welcome to *Object Calisthenics*, beach volleyball edition. This session is about modeling the domain of a beach volleyball league while adhering to strict OOP practices. Check out [this](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/#tl-dr) discussion for a lengthy explanation but focus on the following:  

1. Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
2. Don't Use The ELSE Keyword
3. First Class Collections
4. One Dot Per Line
5. Don't Abbreviate
6. Keep All Classes Small
7. No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
8. Don't directly expose internal state (preserve encapsulation).

You may use any language or testing framework you like.
